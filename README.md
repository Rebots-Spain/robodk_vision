# robodk_vision

To start you will need to install some libraries like open-cv, we recommend contrib because it already has some additional packages such as ArUco (not used in this example)
```
pip install opencv-python
pip install opencv-contrib-python
pip install numpy
pip install mediapipe
```

Then if you want to play around with our vision example detecting the face and hand you can run FaceHandDetect.py
(You will need a semi powerful computer)

I will also attatch the python script for robodk Prog2_vision.py
